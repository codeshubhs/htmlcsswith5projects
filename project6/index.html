        <h2> Steps :-</h2>
        <p>
           <ul>
                <li>
                    Set realistic goals.
                   
                   
                   You may have heard this before, but setting SMART goals can help organize how you approach different achievements. <br>
            </li>
           <li>
            Define your goal. Defined goals put your ideas into action mode. It's the vital step between planning and doing.
           </li>
           <li>
            Create a clear vision. If you want to succeed, you must create a clear compelling vision, something that you can relate to and resonate with. If it doesn't speak to your heart, it won't motivate you to stay on target. Create the highest grandest vision possible, because you can achieve only what you see.
           </li>
           <li>
            Produce a plan. Once you have a goal in place, a plan is will take your vision and break down the steps you need to get it done. A goal without a plan, as we know, is just a dream.
           </li>
           <li>
            Keep it positive. Positive thoughts lead to positive actions, and self-affirming statements will help you to achieve your best. Take control of how you think, how you feel, how you act. Positivity will help you make the choices that lead to accomplishment.
           </li>
